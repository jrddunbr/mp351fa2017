    <h2>Server Room Stuff</h2>
    <h3>Server Stuff</h3>
    <p>
      Reinstalled Hydra with Debian instead of Arch. Amazingly, if you handled it well, Arch was rather stable for the time we used it. Debian is less of a headache though, despite being such a pain when it comes to certain tasks such as complex networking.
    </p>
    <p>
      Worked on Talos, created Talos webpage, and worked on DNS and DHCP gitlab repositories to handle all of our changes to DNS and DHCP. We also set most machines in COSI to have static IP addresses.
    </p>
    <h3>Network Stuff</h3>
    <p>
      Talked with Brian Huntley and organized 10G fiber to be run to COSI.
    </p>
    <p>
      Installed 10G fiber hardware in server room to 4 servers plus the firewall, including Mirror, Bacon, Hydra, and Elephant
